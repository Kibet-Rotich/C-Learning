Welcome to my **C++ Learning Repository** — a collection of all the programs, practice tasks, and small projects I've written while learning C++ from the ground up.

This repo documents my progress from **basic syntax** → **pointers** → **structs** → **dynamic memory** → **custom data structures**, and more.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

The repository contains the following categories of programs:

### 🔹 Beginner Level
- Basic calculations & input/output  
- Simple loops and conditionals  
- Array operations  

### 🔹 Intermediate Level  
- Pointer manipulation  
- References and memory concepts  
- Dynamic arrays  
- Structs and basic data models  

### 🔹 Advanced Beginner / Early Intermediate  
- Simulated vector implementation  
- Dynamic struct arrays  
- Small console applications:
  - Contact App  
  - Student Database  
  - Todo List App  
  - Word Counter  
  - Character Frequency Counter  

---

## 🧱 Key Learning Areas

### ✔️ Pointers & References  
Understanding:
- Pointer basics  
- Pointer arithmetic  
- Dynamic memory allocation (`new`, `delete`)  

### ✔️ Structs  
- Creating custom data types  
- Managing arrays of structs  
- Dynamic struct allocation  

### ✔️ Data Structure Simulations  
- Building a mini vector  
- Implementing simple dynamic lists  

---

## 🗂️ Files Included

Your repo includes **over 50 C++ source files**, covering:

- `*.cpp` — source code  

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Compile

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
```

2. Run

```bash
./output
```

Examples:

```bash
g++ "Todo list App.cpp" -o todo
./todo
```

## 🚀 Goals of This Repository

- Track my C++ progress  
- Practice clean, readable code  
- Prepare for more advanced concepts:
  - OOP  
  - Templates  
  - Standard Template Library (STL)  
  - Memory management in depth  
  - Building real applications  

---

## 🎯 Next Steps in My Learning Journey

After mastering pointers & structs, I will move on to:

- **Object-Oriented Programming** (Classes, inheritance, polymorphism)
- **STL Mastery** (vectors, maps, sets, algorithms)
- **File handling**
- **Building larger C++ systems**
